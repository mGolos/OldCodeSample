* [Analysis notebooks](https://github.com/mGolos/OldCodeSamples/tree/master/Other/Analysis%20notes) are taken from hundreds of notebooks.  
I will probably make a librairy combined with a database one in order to record and show informations of every existing and new notebooks. 
Even for notes not supposed to last, it is always hard to find anything quickly.
* [Simulation' scripts](https://github.com/mGolos/OldCodeSamples/tree/master/Other/Simulation'%20scripts) were python and bash scripts running on TVB cluster or my computer.
